# CatalanNumbers

The Catalan numbers are a sequence of positive integers that appear in many counting problems in combinatorics. They count certain types of lattice paths, permutations, binary trees, and many other combinatorial objects.
In this Repository you will find 2 approaches to finding the *n*th catalan number. 

Both approahes are recurive. However, one is a **Top-Down Approach**, whilst the other utilizes the optimization technique known as **memoization**. Each will print out the Catalan number for the given input and the number of multiplications necessary.
